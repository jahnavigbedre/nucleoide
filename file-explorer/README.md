## Technical Details

### Built With
- **Electron** - Desktop application framework
- **Node.js fs/path** - File system operations
- **Chokidar** - File system watching
- **VS Code Codicons** - Icon library
- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - No frameworks

### Architecture
- **Main Process** (`main.js`) - Handles file system operations via IPC
- **Renderer Process** (`renderer.js`) - Manages UI and user interactions
- **Modular Design** - Clean separation of concerns

### File System Integration
- Recursive directory reading
- Real-time file system monitoring
- Cross-platform file operations
- Error handling and user feedback

## Customization

### Themes
The application uses CSS custom properties for theming. You can modify the colors in `styles.css`:

```css
:root {
    --bg-primary: #1e1e1e;      /* Main background */
    --bg-secondary: #252526;    /* Sidebar background */
    --accent-primary: #007acc;  /* Primary accent color */
    /* ... more variables */
}
```

### File Type Icons
File type icons are mapped in the `getFileIcon()` method in `renderer.js`. You can add new file extensions or modify existing ones.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts are handled in the `handleKeyboardShortcuts()` method. You can add new shortcuts or modify existing ones.

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. **UI Changes** - Modify `index.html` and `styles.css`
2. **Logic Changes** - Update `renderer.js`
3. **File Operations** - Add IPC handlers in `main.js`

### File Watching
The application uses Chokidar for file system monitoring. You can customize the watching behavior in the `setupFileWatcher()` method.

### Error Handling
All file operations include error handling and user feedback. Check the console for detailed error messages during development.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Errors**
   - Ensure the application has read/write permissions for the directories you're accessing

2. **File Watching Issues**
   - Some file systems may have limitations with file watching
   - Check the console for Chokidar warnings

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Large directories may cause performance issues
   - Consider implementing virtual scrolling for very large file trees

### Debug Mode
Run with `npm run dev` to enable developer tools and see detailed console output.
